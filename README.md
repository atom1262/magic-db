Magic DB
========

Phase 1: A community site for amateur magicians to create profiles to upload, discover, and
rate tricks. There are video tutorials of magic tricks numbering into the
thousands; Magic DB is a community-driven collection of these. Users can tag
tricks with appropriate keywords (card trick, closer, opener, etc.) and search
based on these tags.

Phase 2: Users can add tricks to their "routine" and organize them however they
like.

Phase 3: More community-oriented functionality, including a "Magic News" blog
and forums for users to interact.
